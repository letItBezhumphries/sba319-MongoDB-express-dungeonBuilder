I spent some time looking into Pug.js templates and how to render as much content without going overboard, which I eventually did.

To run this project you will need Node.js installed:
_clone down the code for this repo
_ run npm install --save-dev which should install both dev dependencies and dependencies for this project
_will also need to create a .env file in the project directory and add a PORT and assign it to a port number of your choice
_ then in the terminal run: `npm start` to start the server
